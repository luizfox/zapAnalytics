### Dependencies
1. R version >= 3.4.1 for the server

2. node and npm for the client

### Running the server
1. I removed my data file, "galaxias.txt". Please notice that you'll need an equivalent file if you are going to execute the project. You can easily export a file of yours on WhatsApp.

2. run `Rscript server.R`

### Running the client only

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

2. npm run start:client
